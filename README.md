# Work Service Planning API

API done with FastAPI to reflect some assignement:

"Build a REST application from scratch that could serve as a work planning service.
Business requirements:
A worker has shifts
A shift is 8 hours long
A worker never has two shifts on the same day
It is a 24 hour timetable 0-8, 8-16, 16-24
Preferably write a couple of units tests."
